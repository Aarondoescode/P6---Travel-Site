        <p>Sicily is the largest island in the Mediterranean Sea and part of southern Italy, 
            located just off the “toe” of the Italian boot. 
            It has a population of about 5 million people and its capital city is Palermo. 
            The island is home to Mount Etna, one of the most active volcanoes in the world, and features a rich mix of cultures thanks to centuries of Greek, 
            Roman, Arab, and Norman influence.
            With over 600 miles of coastline, delicious local dishes like arancini and cannoli, and historic sites like the Valley of the Temples, 
            Sicily has something for everyone. Enjoy the food, visit a museum, or just take it easy at the beach.</p>
